## 🌱 Project: Emotion Mirror

**What if an AI could be your first listener?**

This project explores the idea of using generative AI to provide **judgment-free, anonymous emotional support**,  
especially for people who feel unable to fully open up to human counselors or therapists.

🔹 Core ideas:
- Free-form, private AI-based conversations  
- Automatic emotional summaries  
- Optional sharing with psychiatrists or clinicians  
- Bridging the gap between self-expression and formal care
