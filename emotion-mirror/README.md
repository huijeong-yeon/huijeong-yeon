# 🪞 Emotion Mirror: AI as Your First Listener

**What if an AI could be your first listener—before you ever talk to a therapist or another human being?**

**Emotion Mirror** is a concept-stage project exploring how generative AI can serve as a low-barrier, judgment-free support system for people experiencing emotional distress.

## 💡 Why This?

Many people find it difficult to speak openly with a human counselor due to:
- Shame, stigma, or fear of judgment
- Cost or limited access to therapists
- Complex emotions that are hard to explain

This project asks:
> What if people could first process their thoughts with an AI  
> —in private, anonymously, without judgment?

## ✨ What It Does (Conceptual Flow)

1. **Open Conversation with AI**  
   Users talk freely, like journaling—no filters, no pressure.

2. **Real-Time Emotion Processing**  
   AI identifies emotional tone, recurring themes, potential red flags.

3. **Structured Summaries**  
   Provides a reflection of what the user shared, grouped by emotion/topic.

4. **Optional Export for Clinicians**  
   Users can export summaries for use in therapy or psychiatric care.
